# Rodolfo Ariel Fernandez  
  
I am a person who likes to say that his day was productive day and that I'm closer to meeting the goals that I proposed to myself and those that we proposed as a team.  
  
I do not like to feel that I’m not making any progress therefore I'm always looking for new challenges, something to learn, improving the things I do well and learning from mistakes, I adapt well to any team whether large or small, local or remote and my level of English has allowed me to communicate smoothly with clients and members of the team.
